# Deep-Learning-Based-Soft-Sensor-for-SRU-Process
Applied LSTM networks to estimate key variables in a sulfur recovery unit (SRU) of a refinery plant. Achieved accurate predictions for process optimization, even in offline analyzer scenarios. Results validate LSTM's efficacy for industrial dynamical modeling.
